 Life Cycle of hibernate Object
 
 1) Transient 	-> Object is created but not associated with hibernate 
 					or hibernate session
 					like Customer c = new Customer("Amit kumar");
 
 
 
 2) Persistent   -> Object is available in the DB  and also synched with hibernate sesssion
 					any attempt to call setXYZ(...) will refelcts back in the DB too.
 					
 
 
 3) Detached   -> session.close()
                   Obj is available in the Db but session has close()
 
 4) removed 	-> Object is removed or deleteion process
 					DB (to be deleted )
 					Association with hibernate session :  YES , until we dont call flush()
 					session.delete()
 					t.commit()
 					after commit object is not synched
